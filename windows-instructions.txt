Since Windows has problems with symlinks, when you checkout symlinks, it will create files with paths.
On Windows Vista and above, do this to convert to symlinks:

1. Open Powershell and position yourself in the root of the repository (in Github for Windows right-click on the repository and press open in Git Shell
2. Run these two lines:
$script = [IO.File]::ReadAllText('.\symlinks.ps')
invoke-expression $script

NOTE: Be careful not to run this if symlinks are already created or it will create a symlink from the content of the symlink!
