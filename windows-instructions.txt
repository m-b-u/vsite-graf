Since Windows has problems with symlinks, when you checkout symlinks, it will create files with paths from symlinks.
On Windows Vista and above, do this to convert to symlinks:

1. Open GitHub for Windows, right-click on the repository and press open in Git Shell (Powershell needs to be your preferred shell)
2. Execcute the following line
.\symlinks.ps1
